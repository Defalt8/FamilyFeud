## important notes

- The `Questions.txt` files must be present in all 4 round directories and each one must contain at least one question.
- The name of the answers' filename must not contain white-spaces.
  - example: `bodyache.txt Name a part of your body that you might say has an "ache"`
- To add a new question to a specific round you just have to add an entry like the above to the Questions.txt specific to that round.
- Keep the `rounds` directory in the same directory as the main executable.
